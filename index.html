    <h1 id="titleText">The Psychic Game</h1>
    <p id="directionsText"> You have 9 tries to guess what letter I am thinking of.
        <br>
        Any letter in the alphabet A-Z. No special characters, no tricky magic.
        <br>
        If you manage to crack the code, you are awarded a point and the computer resets and you get to prove
        yourself again.
        <br>
        If you do not guess correctly, your guess will be recorded and you may try again.
        If you are unable to decipher the code in 9 tries, you have lost.
        The code will reset.
    </p>
